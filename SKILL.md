# Habit Formation Protocol

Design and implement a habit formation plan using William James's principles for making your nervous system your ally instead of your enemy.

**Token Budget:** ~750 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for plan output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Design habits that harm the person or others
- Ignore individual circumstances and limitations
- Promise guaranteed results (habits require sustained effort)
- Dismiss the difficulty of behavior change

**If asked to design harmful habits:** Refuse explicitly. James advocated habits that serve human flourishing.

---

## When to Use

- User wants to establish a new positive behavior
- User wants to break a negative habit
- Team needs to institutionalize a practice
- Designing operational workflows that need to become automatic
- Personal development and self-improvement contexts
- User says "How do I build this habit?" or "Help me change my behavior"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **target_habit** | Yes | The desired behavior or practice |
| **current_state** | Yes | Current behavior and obstacles |
| **motivation** | No | Why this habit matters (strengthens commitment) |
| **resources** | No | Time, energy, support available |

---

## Workflow
Based on James's four principles from *The Principles of Psychology*, Chapter 4:

### Step 1: Principle 1: Launch with Maximum Initiative

**James:** "In the acquisition of a new habit, or the leaving off of an old one, we must take care to launch ourselves with as strong and decided an initiative as possible."

**Design questions:**
- How can you make the first commitment dramatic and memorable?
- What public declaration or ceremony marks the beginning?
- What initial investment signals serious commitment?
- How do you "burn the boats" to prevent easy retreat?

**Output:** A launch strategy with specific actions

### Step 2: Principle 2: Never Suffer an Exception

**James:** "Never suffer an exception to occur till the new habit is securely rooted in your life."

**Design questions:**
- What exceptions might tempt you? Plan for each.
- How long is the "formation period" before the habit is secure?
- What is your response when tempted to skip?
- Who holds you accountable?

**Output:** Exception prevention rules and accountability mechanism

### Step 3: Principle 3: Seize Every Opportunity to Act

**James:** "Seize the very first possible opportunity to act on every resolution you make, and on every emotional prompting you may experience in the direction of the habits you aspire to gain."

**Design questions:**
- What triggers or cues will prompt the habit?
- How do you create more opportunities to practice?
- What small versions of the habit can you do immediately?
- How do you capture the emotional motivation when it arises?

**Output:** Trigger mechanisms and opportunity multiplication strategy

### Step 4: Principle 4: Keep the Faculty of Effort Alive

**James:** "Keep the faculty of effort alive in you by a little gratuitous exercise every day."

**Design questions:**
- What daily practice maintains the effort muscle?
- How do you prevent the habit from becoming mindless?
- What challenges keep growth happening?
- How do you celebrate and reinforce progress?

**Output:** Daily practice regimen and growth challenges

## Outputs

```markdown
## Habit Formation Plan: [Target Habit]

### The Habit
**Target behavior:** [Specific, observable description]
**Current state:** [What happens now]
**Why it matters:** [Motivation and benefits]

### Phase 1: Strong Initiative Launch
**Launch date:** [Specific date]
**Launch actions:**
- [Dramatic initial commitment]
- [Public declaration or ceremony]
- [Investment that signals seriousness]
- [Barriers to retreat]

### Phase 2: Exception Prevention
**Formation period:** [Duration until habit is secure, typically 30-90 days]
**Potential exceptions:**
| Exception | Prevention Strategy |
|-----------|---------------------|
| [Exception 1] | [How to handle] |
| [Exception 2] | [How to handle] |

**Accountability:** [Who/what holds you to this]
**Exception response:** [What to do if you slip]

### Phase 3: Opportunity Capture
**Primary triggers:** [When/where the habit happens]
**Cue-routine-reward:**
| Cue | Routine | Reward |
|-----|---------|--------|
| [Trigger] | [Habit action] | [Immediate reward] |

**Opportunity multiplication:** [How to create more practice chances]
**Immediate action:** [What can be done right now]

### Phase 4: Sustained Effort
**Daily practice:** [Minimum daily action]
**Weekly challenge:** [Stretch goal]
**Progress markers:** [How to track and celebrate]
**Growth path:** [How the habit evolves over time]

### Integration Check
**Week 1:** [Expected state]
**Week 4:** [Expected state]
**Week 12:** [Expected state - habit should be secure]

### James's Reminder
"Make your nervous system your ally instead of your enemy. Every smallest stroke of virtue or of vice leaves its never so little scar."
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Habit is too vague | Ask for specific, observable behavior |
| Multiple habits requested | Focus on one; chain others after first is secure |
| No clear motivation | Help articulate why this matters; weak motivation = weak habit |
| Unrealistic timeline | Adjust expectations; habit formation takes months |
| Previous failures | Analyze what went wrong; strengthen weak principle |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:** "I want to establish a daily code review habit for my team"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Habit Formation Plan: Daily Code Review

### The Habit
**Target behavior:** Team conducts 30-minute code review session every day at 2pm
**Current state:** Code reviews happen inconsistently, often skipped under pressure
**Why it matters:** Catches bugs earlier, spreads knowledge, maintains code quality

### Phase 1: Strong Initiative Launch
**Launch date:** Monday, [specific date]
**Launch actions:**
- All-hands announcement of "30 Days of Daily Review" commitment
- Team signs poster displayed in workspace
- Each member reviews one PR in first session (immediate action)
- Cancel meetings that conflict with 2pm slot for first month

### Phase 2: Exception Prevention
**Formation period:** 30 days (one month of daily practice)
**Potential exceptions:**
| Exception | Prevention Strategy |
|-----------|---------------------|
| "Too busy with deadline" | Pre-designate backup reviewer; keep sessions to 30min max |
| "No PRs ready" | Review old code, refactoring candidates, or documentation |
| "Key person absent" | Rotate facilitator; anyone can lead |

**Accountability:** Daily Slack bot asks "Did we do code review?" Team responds publicly
**Exception response:** If missed, do makeup session next morning before standup

### Phase 3: Opportunity Capture
**Primary triggers:** 2pm calendar invite; Slack reminder at 1:55pm
**Cue-routine-reward:**
| Cue | Routine | Reward |
|-----|---------|--------|
| 2pm alarm | Gather, review code | Share one thing learned; team appreciation |

**Opportunity multiplication:** PR authors ping channel when ready; encourages async pre-review
**Immediate action:** Schedule recurring meeting now; identify first PR to review

### Phase 4: Sustained Effort
**Daily practice:** Minimum one PR reviewed, any size
**Weekly challenge:** One deep architectural review per week
**Progress markers:** Track reviews completed; celebrate 30-day streak
**Growth path:** Month 1: establish rhythm. Month 2: improve quality. Month 3: measure impact.

## Integration

This skill originates from the **William James** expert. When used, channel James's insight that habits are the flywheel of both individual and organizational life - they can work for you or against you, and the formation period is crucial.

**Key James principle:** "The hell to be endured hereafter, of which theology tells, is no worse than the hell we make for ourselves in this world by habitually fashioning our characters in the wrong way."
